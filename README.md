# Sorting-Algorithm
The project compares five sorting algorithms by generating random arrays, sorting them, and measuring the average time taken. It analyzes the performance and time complexity for different array sizes.

# Empirical Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Description
This project implements and compares the performance of five sorting algorithms:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. QuickSort

The program generates random arrays of doubles, sorts them using the specified algorithm, and calculates the average running time. The results are used to empirically verify the asymptotic time complexity of each algorithm.

## Features
- Empirical comparison of sorting algorithms.
- Time complexity analysis (both average and worst case).
- Asymptotic constant factor calculation for each algorithm.

## How to Run

## Files
- `Project_1.java`: The main Java source file containing implementations of the sorting algorithms.
- `Project_1.class`: The compiled bytecode of the Java file.
- `CSci433Project1.pdf`: The project instructions.
- `Project 1 Report.docx` and `Project 1 Report.pdf`: The project report documenting the analysis and findings.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Project_1.java
   
java Project_1 <sorting_algorithm> <number_of_arrays> <array_size>
For example: java Project_1 merge 1000 2000
